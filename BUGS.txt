        Bug(minor)! Do not directly use STL in 'file_device.h'.
    JAVA
        Bug(minor)! Fatal error when building deps of java/build/make/native.mak under cygwin from make (but direct commands from the shell)
    XSL
        (Bug minor!) xsltproc infinite loop with interleaved tags.
            <tag id="tag1">...<tag ref="tag2"/>...</tag>
            <tag id="tag2">...<tag ref="tag1"/>...</tag>
            Seems non-sens however.


FIXED in 2.4
(Oct, 1st 2009)
    * Bug(major)! DELETE key management missing in cli::Shell class.

FIXED in 2.3
(May, 18th 2009)
    * Bug(major)! cppclic.xsl correction for SAXON compatibility
    * Bug(minor)! Errors due to oversized words in CommandLine are not notified to the user.
    * Bug(minor)! xsltproc crash when the tag[@ref] is directly located in the tag[@id]

FIXED in 2.2
(Sep, 21st 2008)
    * major! IOMux device closure error.
    * major! cli::tk::Queue::Iterator [tk_stl.h] definition revision. Incompatible with some compilers.
    * major! Java object consistency problems.
    * major! XSL generation errors for menus directly generated for an endl node.
    * major! Bad cppclic.xsl generation for 2 level menu structures.
    * major! Memory leak in Queue::~Queue() [tk_inner.h] -> m_arptQueue was not destroyed.
    * major! Consistency errors because of static constant objects in C++ files when compiled with Visual .NET. Singleton used instead.
    * major! Bad javaclic.xsl generation for 2 level menu structures. Test addition.
    * major! History cannot store more than 100 command lines
    * minor! InputFileDevice::GetKey(): unknown characters do not end the file anymore.
    * minor! Spelling error: "Uncomplete" changed to "Incomplete" in CommandLine::Parse().
    * minor! System includes (#include <>) changed into project includes (#include "").
    * minor! When an input file does not exist (cli::InputFileDevice), no error message is printed out. => Addition of a m_cliLastError member in cli::OutputDevice, that can be set by all subclasses.
    * minor! TAB when the line is empty does nothing.
