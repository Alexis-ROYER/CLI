    <h1>Presentation</h1>

    <p>
    CLI stands for <i>Command Line Interface</i>.
    It is essentially a library,
    and a set of tools that allow you do such kind of things:
    <center>
    <table>
    <tr><td bgcolor="#ffffcc" align="center"><i>XML resource file</i></td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#eeeeee" valign="top">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;cli name="<b>Hello</b>" xmlns="http://alexis.royer.free.fr/CLI"&gt;
 &lt;cpp option="include"&gt;<b>#include "hello.h"</b>&lt;/cpp&gt;

 &lt;keyword string="<b>say</b>"&gt;&lt;help lang="en"&gt;<b>Tell Something.</b>&lt;/help&gt;
  &lt;keyword string="<b>hello</b>"&gt;&lt;help lang="en"&gt;<b>Just say hello.</b>&lt;/help&gt;
   &lt;endl&gt;&lt;cpp&gt;<b>sayHello();</b>&lt;/cpp&gt;&lt;/endl&gt;
  &lt;/keyword&gt;
  &lt;keyword string="<b>bye</b>"&gt;&lt;help lang="en"&gt;<b>Say goodbye.</b>&lt;/help&gt;
   &lt;endl&gt;&lt;cpp&gt;<b>sayBye();</b>&lt;/cpp&gt;&lt;/endl&gt;
  &lt;/keyword&gt;
 &lt;/keyword&gt;
&lt;/cli&gt;
</pre>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td bgcolor="#ffffcc" align="center"><i>CLI execution</i></td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#eeeeee" valign="top">
        <img src="hello.jpg"/>
    </td>
    </table>
    </center>
    </p>

    <p>
    When the user enters 'say', he/she can then enter either <i>'hello'</i> or <i>'bye'</i>.
    When he/she enters <i>'hello'</i> and presses the return key,
    the CLI library automatically calls the user-defined function <i>'sayHello()'</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    This 'Hello world' example shows the direct relationship
    between the XML resource file and the CLI execution.
    Here is now a more complete list of the CLI library features:
    <ol>
        <li><b>completion and help:</b>
            The user has facilities to get into the set of commands.
            The CLI library automatically manages completion,
            and help can be set for most of CLI elements.
        </li>
        <li><b>keywords:</b>
            A command line is generally composed by a sequence of keywords
            terminated by a carriage return
            (symbolized through the <i>'endl'</i> XML element).
        </li>
        <li><b>parameters:</b>
            Parameters can be used instead of keywords.
            The CLI library manages parameters of different types, such as:
            strings, integers, floats, host names.
        </li>
        <li><b>tags:</b>
            Tags act like labels do in C/C++ code.
            As far as it said to be ugly in C/C++, it is wonderful stuff in CLI.
            It allows you to implement recursive command lines
            or command lines with optional extensions (basically for options).
        </li>
        <li><b>menus:</b>
            User defined commands can lead to user defined menus,
            which contain other own set of user defined commands,
            and so on...
        </li>
        <li><b>generic input/output:</b>
            Input/output can be easily redirected.
            The library currently gives support for the following input/output devices:
            console, TCP connections, files, single commands.
            RS232 and full telnet are planned in the short or middle term.
            But you may implement your own intput/output device if you need it.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

<a name="howto"/>
    <h1>How does it work?</h1>

    <p>
    Considering you already have the user code to execute at end,
    all you have to do is the following:
    <ol>
        <li>Edit an <b>XML resource file</b>;</li>
        <li><b>Transform</b> the XML resource file into target language code;</li>
        <li>Depending on the target language, <b>integrate</b> the result of the transformation.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    For instance, in C++, the result of the transformation is a C++ source file.
    You should therefore compile it
    and link it with the CLI library and your user defined program.
    You should also make a call somewhere in your program
    to launch the execution of your CLI.
    In most cases, it should not be too difficult to have it work quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
    In Java, compile the Java source file resulting of the transformation.
    Then use the CLI object defined in it and the CLI library to launch it.
    Just ensure you have the CLI library available from your paths.
    That's it.
    </p>

    <p>
    The transformation step is just an XSLT transformation
    using an XSL stylesheet provided with the library.
    Therefore, the most difficult (and it aims to be easy) is the XML resource file edition.
    Have a look at the <a href="user-guide/cli-user-guide.html">CLI user guide</a> for more information.
    </p>


<a name="use"/>
    <h1>Possible use</h1>

    <p>
    Here is a list of possible interests you could have in this projects:
    <ul>
        <li><b>text-based user interface:</b>
            The CLI library is essentially a text-based user interface,
            so, obviously, it can be used to define such kind of interfaces.
            We must admit that graphical user interfaces are much more attractive,
            however text-based interfaces have the advantage to easily get a file for input.
            Instructions can be saved and replayed later on.</li>
        <li><b>monitoring:</b>
            It is sometimes useful to have a secondary user interface,
            for monitoring operations for instance,
            fully dissociated from the primary one.</li>
        <li><b>configuration files</b>
            You can easily define a specific configuration file syntax with the CLI library.
            Therefore, you could use it instead of .ini files or XML files.</li>
        <li><b>automation:</b>
            Since CLI is text-based, it is compatible with automation.
            Automated test tools generally need to interact with target tested equipments or softwares.
            The CLI library is an easy way to implement an entry point on target equipments for unit tests.</li>
        <li><b>parsing facilities:</b>
            The CLI library can be used for its command line parsing ability.
            I've already used it to make out a compiler for instance.</li>
        <li><b>reuse of code:</b>
            Eventually, if the XML CLI definition does not fit your needs,
            but you are interested in what the library does on the other hand,
            you could directly use the C++ objects of the library.
            You shall therefore have a look at
            the <a href="doxygen">doxygen</a> documentation of the library.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
