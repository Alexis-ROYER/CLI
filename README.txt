PURPOSE
  The CLI library makes it easy to generate command line interfaces.

VERSION
  This is the very first release of the library.
  I labelled it '1.0.beta1-1'.
  Do not expect robustness or efficiency for the moment, it is still experimental.
  Only C++ feature is available at present.

INSTALL
  This library needs the 'ncurses' library for the console mode.
  Assuming this, you should compile the library from the sources using 'make'.

USE
  Write CLI definitions in XML files.
  Generate C++ code thanks to the XSL stylesheet.
  Compile and link with libcppcli.
  Enjoy... as far as it works :)

  ...
  So much more! To be continued.
